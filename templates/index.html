    <h1>Welcome to Actor Finder</h1>
    <h3>A project by Mason Myre</h3>
    <p>Have you ever been talking with a friend and realize you don't know that actor's name, only to say "oh yeah it was that one guy, who played in those two movies" well I haven't because I don't have friends so hopefully you find this more useful than I do!</p>
    <p>How does it work?</p>
    <p>I'm glad you asked! Simply input the titles of two movies and you will receive all of the actors who were in both of those movies.</p>
    <p>I am still working on the functionality to add multiple movies in the same search but I don't really know what I am doing when it comes to html so it might take a while.</p>
